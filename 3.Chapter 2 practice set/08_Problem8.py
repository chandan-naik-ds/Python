'''A temperature sensor records values: 36.5, 37.0, 36.8.

Store them in variables

Identify which data type is most appropriate and why.'''

T1 = 36.5
T2 = 37.0
T3 = 36.8

print(T1,type(T1), T2,type(T2), T3,type(T3))

'''Float is the most appropriate data type because temperature values contain decimals and 
represent continuous data that can vary in small increments.'''
